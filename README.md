## Running the Project with Docker

To set up and run the project using Docker, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install it from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

### Build and Run with Docker

#### Build the Docker Image

In the root directory of your project, where the Dockerfile is located, run the following command to build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t 100x-job_board .
```

A Docker image named 100x-job_board will be created .

#### Run the Docker Container
Once the image is built, then run:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env 100x-job_board
```
This command uses the .env file for environment variables and maps port 3000 on your host to port 3000 in the container.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the 100x. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to maintainers.

The following is a summary of the ideal contribution flow. Please, note that Pull Requests can also be rejected by the maintainers when appropriate.

## Getting Started

### Issues

Don't open issues for questions or support, instead discuss it with maintainers on discord first.

- Feel free to submit issues and enhancement requests.
- Before creating an issue, please check that it hasn't already been reported.
- Please use issue templates if available.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Please test your code if needed.
3. Ensure the code passes edge cases.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

### Conventional Commits

Pull requests should have a title that follows the specification, otherwise, merging is blocked. If you are not familiar with the specification simply ask maintainers to modify. You can also use this cheatsheet if you want:

- `fix: ` prefix in the title indicates that PR is a bug fix and PATCH release must be triggered.
- `feat: ` prefix in the title indicates that PR is a feature and MINOR release must be triggered.
- `docs: ` prefix in the title indicates that PR is only related to the documentation and there is no need to trigger release.
- `chore: ` prefix in the title indicates that PR is only related to cleanup in the project and there is no need to trigger release.

## Setting Up the Development Environment
We have discussed this in detail [here](README.md).

Happy contributing :)
